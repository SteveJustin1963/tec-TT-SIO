; This is a serial input and output routine. The store_st and store_end variables define the start and end address 
; in memory where the data will be stored. The get_b subroutine gets a byte from the serial port and stores it in memory. 
; The outb subroutine outputs a byte to the serial port. The dl_1 and dl_2 subroutines provide delays.
